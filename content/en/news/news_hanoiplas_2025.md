    From June 4 to 7, 2025, our company participated in the Vietnam International Plastics and Rubber Industry Exhibition (VietnamPlas Hanoi 2025), which was grandly held at the Vietnam National Convention Center in Hanoi. This exhibition focused on cutting-edge technologies and solutions across the plastics, rubber, and packaging industries, attracting over 400 exhibitors from more than 20 countries and regions, as well as more than 20 thousand professional visitors.

    At this year’s exhibition, our company showcased its core products — the Automatic Air Ring System and Online Thickness Measurement Instrument — which drew significant interest from blown film equipment manufacturers, packaging companies, and distributors from countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and beyond. Many professionals visited our booth for consultation and discussion.

    During the event, we received numerous professional clients who expressed recognition of our products’ stability, cost-effectiveness, and after-sales service capabilities. Many of them proactively left their contact information for further follow-up discussions. As the packaging manufacturing industry is currently experiencing rapid growth, there is a growing demand in the market for high-efficiency and highly stable blown film auxiliary equipment. Our participation in this exhibition has further strengthened our global brand influence in the field of blown film automation solutions.

    Through this exhibition, we have reaffirmed our international development strategy of “Quality First, Customer Foremost, and Integrity-Based Service.” Looking ahead, we will continue to increase our investment in the Vietnamese and surrounding markets, providing more partners with professional and efficient products and services.
